            the student, Instructor (as defined below), or other User (as defined below) who accesses or uses the

            Products. If you are a parent, guardian, or other person who enables a child to access the Company Products,
            you
            agree to stand in the shoes of such child for the purposes of making us whole in case of damages or
            indemnification that could properly lie against a child, if not for his or her age. This Site is intended
            for
            use by you only if you are 13 years of age or older.
        </p>

            representative of that Subscribing Entity with the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, and (ii)

        <h2>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements</h2>

        <p>
            Company respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other
            intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be
            tolerated on or through the Company Products.
        </p>

        <p>
            Company's intellectual property policy is to (a) remove material that Company believes in good faith, upon
            notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a
            third party by being made available through the Company Products, and (b) remove any Submitted Content
            posted to the Site by "repeat infringers." Company considers a "repeat infringer" to be any User that has
            uploaded Submitted Content to the Site and for whom Company has received more than two takedown notices
            compliant with respect to such Submitted Content. Company has discretion, however, to terminate the account
            of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Company's own
            determination.

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

        <p>

        <h3>Mandatory Arbitration</h3>
        Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND COMPANY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES,
        AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR
        MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS
        PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE
        COMPANY PRODUCTS. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
        arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to
        very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
        Please visit www.amic.org for more information about arbitration.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Commencing Arbitration</h3>
        A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of
        intent to arbitrate (a "Notice"), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Company, to you
        via any other method available to Company, including via e-mail. The Notice to Company should be addressed
        to: Uberlearner Inc., 609 8th Street SW, Suite 1504, Calgary, AB - T2P2A6, Canada (the "Arbitration Notice
        Address"). The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the
        specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If you and Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim
        within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding as set
        forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE Canadian
        Dispute Resolution Company ("CDRC") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE
        SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. If you
        are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Company, then Company will promptly
        reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Company's receipt of Notice at the
        Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of
        the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000, in which case you are solely
        responsible for the payment of the filing fee.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Arbitration Proceeding</h3>
        The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator
        shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Company agree to comply with the
        following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and
        burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based
        on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the
        arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
        agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
        entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>No Class Actions</h3>
        YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
        CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND
        MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC
        PROVISION IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE
        NULL AND VOID.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Decision of the Arbitrator</h3>
        Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the
        date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the
        interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all
        records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of
        the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting
        forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the province of
        Alberta in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these Terms and your use of the Services
        evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
        These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the substantive laws of the province of Alberta
        without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Only if the Mandatory Arbitration clause is
        deemed to be null and void, then all disputes arising between you and Company under these Terms shall be
        subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, Court of Queen's Bench, or Court of Appeal
        located in Calgary, Alberta, and you and Company hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of
        these courts.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Equitable Relief</h3>
        The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which Company seeks
        equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of these Terms by Company or
        any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other
        equitable relief against Company, including with respect to any Submitted Content, and your only remedy
        shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Claims</h3>
        You and Company agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any
        cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services, excluding a claim for
        indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of
        action is permanently barred.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>Improperly Filed Claims</h3>
        All claims you bring against Company must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.
        All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section shall be considered improperly
        filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, Company may recover attorneys'
        fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Company has notified you in writing of the improperly filed
        claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
