{% extends 'accounts/email/confirmation/confirmation_sent.html' %}

{% comment %}
The view for the "verification_sent" page is hard-coded in django-allauth. Till that problem is fixed, an
alias for accounts/email/confirmation/confirmation_sent.html will have to be made at account/verification_sent.html.
This template is that alias.
